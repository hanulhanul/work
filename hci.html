        This is a project focused more on methodology than production. I am not only the creator but more importantly the curator, and my curation becomes the most pivotal element of the project. I reflect on my working experience with my computer in
        the light of "Actor-Network Theory" based on autoethnographic and digital-ethnographic methods. The final product is a visual and computational expression of my investigation and contemplation. I am particularly interested in the ideas of
        agency & authorship that emerge in my intimate relationship between myself and my machine.

        Actor-Network Theory is "an ongoing project that seeks to radically transform how social scientists talk about society’s relationship to technology and other nonhuman actors." Actor–network theory is "an approach to research that sits with a
        broader body of new materialism; a body of work that displaces humanism to consider dynamic assemblages of humans and nonhumans." Actor-Network Theory's core understanding includes that "what the social sciences usually call ‘society’ is an
        ongoing achievement. Actor-Network Theory is an attempt to provide analytical tools for explaining the very process by which society is constantly reconfigured. What distinguishes it from other constructivist approaches is its explanation of
        society in the making, in which science and technology play a key part."

        The final product utilizes a machine learning model called PoseNet that enables "real-time human pose estimation in the browser." The model is created by ml5.js, which is a powerful and accessible resource powered by TensorFlow.js and
        programmed in p5.js for creative sketching. When the prototype loads on the web browser, it immediately reads the visual data of human body shapes captured on the camera. The ml5.js library is developed by a group of progressive and
        open-minded artists and engineers who shared a common interest in making machine learning's pose estimation technology accessible and artistic. The library is completely open source, and its creators do not seek corporate profits from its
        distribution to the public.

        experience and reflect on the direct co-creative process with the machine through their physical motions. I aim to invoke the questions regarding materiality and virtuality through my work. How do physical bodies interact with software
        interfaces, and how are the material movements manifested in the virtual realm?

        The keywords agency and authorship are significant in my reflections. The word "agency" means "the capacity, condition, or state of acting or of exerting power," synonymous with "operation", according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. The
        word "authorship" means "the state or act of writing, creating, or causing" according to the same source. The idea of agency emphasizes the "capacity, condition, or state" of the creative act, whereas the sense of authorship focuses on the
        act itself whether it is of "writing, creating, or causing" in the creative processes. If agency signifies the state of creation, authorship notes the action of creativity.

        "Agency"
      </p>
      <div class="col-lg-1 col-md-1"></div>
      <p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7">
        In terms of agency, there have been two primary reflections on the state of creation for my final product. First, the human and the computer are both equally important creators and collaborators. This is based on the understanding of
        Actor-Network Theory that "humans are not privileged among countless actors/actants, all of which are ontologically symmetrical." This idea points to the immediate, simultaneous, and irreplaceable presences of both human and machine
        participants in my product. Each of the human and the machine completes the premise of the project, and neither one of them is capable of sustaining the sketch without the other.
        <br /><br />Second, the human and the computer are elevated thanks to their shared state of agency. This realization relates to the notion in Actor-Network Theory that "actors/actants gain strength only through their alliances. These
        propositions have specific implications for data generation, analysis, and reporting." The agency of the human includes creating physical motions but also reacting to the visual results on the computer and making next movements based on what
        they see. The agency of the machine is not only its digital drawings but also its incessant registration of the human's changing motions. Their collaborative and codependent relations to each other enhance each of their sense of agency, and
        as a result, allow for the production of real-time, interactive sketching.
      </p>
      <p class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
        "Authorship"
      </p>
      <div class="col-lg-1 col-md-1"></div>
      <p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7">
        When it comes to authorship, there are two significant understandings in relation to my final product. Firstly, the human and the computer are in a singular and mutual authorship rather than two separate, respective authorships. Based on
        Actor-Network Theory, "actors/actants transform to a different state via mediation when they encounter each other." In my project, the human's role is creating motions with their bodies and the machine's role is drawing on the screen based on
        the pose estimations. However, together, they produce real-time, interactive drawings of bodily movements, and their reliance on each other's role is absolute in order to complete their own task. The human and the machine, together, create
        one singular product, which is the drawing of body motions on the digital screen.
        <br /><br />Secondly, the human and the machine in active creative processes are the only agencies of creation. Actor-Network Theory states that "there is no essence within or beyond any process of assemblage. Actors are concrete; there is no
        'potential' other than their actions in the moment. Entities are nothing more than an effect of assemblage." In the instance of my product, the only actors in assemblage are the computer in active use and the human in active participation. No
        other computers and devices with screens or other people waiting in line to try it out are agencies but the ones who are in active participation at the moment.
